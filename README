There is bunch of files and I'm gonna explain what they do...

First, there is one (for now) header file... This file required to compile&run 'java-in.c' file.
Contains general author information and build information... Also have some 'warn-fixes' (as you understand by name)
applied on the file... [ stupid c-prototypes etc... ]

2) There are bunch of *.c files too... They are intended to do some specific work... Except java-in.c file!
 -> human.c: implements human-like math operations and high limit integers...
 -> performancetest.c: created for performance testing by counting prime numbers... Has custom option and rates your CPU...
 	Note: This application uses only 1 core... So all the rating will done on your machines only depends on how fast your cpu is and how good optimized instruction set your cpu have...
 -> java-in.c: half junk half good, i re-write all the things we did in java class, plus things i wanted to do in free time...
 
3) I haven't choosen a license yet, but this does not mean you can f**k the code up. Please give credit and use open-source material for your projects if you want to use any single character from my files...
